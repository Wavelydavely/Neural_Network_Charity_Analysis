We are looking for charities which do not use their revenue efficiently 

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
We chose RELU because of its overarching popularity

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

This dataset provided a challenge to target model performance.
'IS_SUCCESSFUL'

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

We tried to eliminate superfluous features of our original model
